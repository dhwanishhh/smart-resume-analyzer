# Smart Resume Analyzer (NLP)

A powerful NLP-based resume analyzer that extracts key information (skills, education, experience) from resumes (PDF/Text) and ranks candidates based on their match to a job description using sentence similarity (BERT/cosine similarity). Built using Python, spaCy, and sentence-transformers — tested in Google Colab.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

HR teams spend a lot of time manually screening resumes. This tool automates the process using Natural Language Processing to:

- Extract skills, education, and experience from resumes
- Compare resumes to a job description
- Rank candidates by similarity
- 
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)
- spaCy (NLP)
- PyPDF
- python-docx
- Gradio
- pyngrok

## 🧪 Features

✅ Upload a PDF resume  
✅ Extract structured data (skills, education, experience)  
✅ Input a job description  
✅ Score and rank resumes based on similarity to the job description  
✅ View extracted information in real-time (via Colab and opened on gradio)

## 📒 How It Works

1. Upload a resume in PDF format
2. Paste a job description
3. The model extracts relevant entities and computes a similarity score
4. Results are displayed directly in gradio site
